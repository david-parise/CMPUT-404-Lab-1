7. Question 7
-  <H3>Form Contents:</H3>
   <DL>
   <DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
   <DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
   </DL>

   The above content changed in the output of https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hindle1/1.py when we used -X POST. The above block was originally:

   <H3>Form Contents:</H3>
   <P>No form fields.
   <DL>
   </DL>

-  POST is a method that allows us to send content to the specified URL.
